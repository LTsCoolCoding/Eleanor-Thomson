This project collects, cleans, and analyzes historical financial market data for multiple asset classes — including the **S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Gold, Oil, and Bitcoin** — over the period **2010–2024**.  
It uses the `yfinance` library to pull daily price data, formats and fills missing values, and calculates **annual returns** based on year-end prices.  
The analysis also integrates **macroeconomic indicators** such as the **U.S. M2 money supply** and **employment statistics** from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), enabling deeper business intelligence insights.
